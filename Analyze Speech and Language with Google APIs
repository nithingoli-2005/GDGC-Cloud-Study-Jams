🧪 Hands-on Activities / Challenge Lab
Module / Task	Description / Goal
Challenge Lab (ARC114)	Apply your skills in a semi-structured scenario. You’ll:
• Create API key
• Call Natural Language API for entity analysis
• Call Speech API for transcription
• Perform sentiment analysis

Text Analysis Tasks	Use the Natural Language API to identify entities, classify sentiment, parse parts of speech, etc.
Speech Analysis Task	Process a provided audio file (e.g. from Cloud Storage) through the Speech API to get a transcript.
🧰 Technologies & Tools Used

Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

Cloud Natural Language API

Cloud Speech API

Google Cloud Console & Cloud Shell

curl, JSON request/response files

Python (for sentiment analysis scripting)

📈 Outcomes & Benefits

You’ll gain practical skills in text and speech analytics using Google Cloud APIs.

You’ll understand how to chain APIs (speech → text → language analysis).

You’ll strengthen debugging and independent learning since the challenge lab requires self-driven problem solving.

You’ll earn a skill badge / credit showcasing your competency in speech & language processing on the cloud.
